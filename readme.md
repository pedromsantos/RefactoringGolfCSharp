Refactoring Golf is a game designed to explore your IDE to see what's really possible using shortcuts and automation.

You will find two versions of every project:
- ROUND_N_A
- ROUND_N_B

The _A project is the before (in gold terms, the "tee"), and the _B project is the after (the "hole").

Your goal is to safely and efficiently as possible refactor the _A code to look like the _B code. You must aim to do it in as few "strokes" as possible, incurring as few points as possible.

A "stroke" is a change made to the code, and every stroke costs you points.

Your pairing partner should carefully score you as follows:

## Add points
- +1 points for every refactor
- +1 points for every Copy+paste
- +1 points for every change made to the code using a shortcut or automated IDE feature (e.g., an automated refactoring, code template, or Find/Replace)

## Plus points
- +2 points for every line of code manually edited
- X2 points For every change made while the code cannot pass the tests after the previous change

## Empty points
- +0 points revert changes (ctrl + z git revert)
- +0 points formating
- +0 points remove code
- +0 points remove lines
- +0 points change access methods or clases
